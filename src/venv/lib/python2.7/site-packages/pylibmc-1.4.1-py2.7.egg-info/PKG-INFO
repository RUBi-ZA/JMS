        New in version 1.4.0
        ====================
        
        Brace yourself, Python 3.x support has come!
        
        Thanks to everybody involved in this project; this release involves less
        authors but **a lot** more work per person. Thanks especially to Harvey Falcic
        for the work he put in, without which there wouldn't be any Python 3.x support.
        Also thanks to Sergey Pashinin for the initial stab at the problem.
        
        Other than that, we had miscellaneous bug fixes, testing improvements, and
        documentation updates.
        
        Last but not least I would like to ask for your support in this project, either
        by helping out with development, testing, documentation or anything at all; or
        simply by donating some `magic internet money`__ to the project's Bitcoin
        address `12dveKhqiJWCY8zXT4kaHdHELXPeGAUo9h`__.
